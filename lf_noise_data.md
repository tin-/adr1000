---

Total number of devices evaluated in this test:

* 49 ADR1000AHZ production devices, manufactured with date code 39 week 2018
* 5 LTZ1000CH production devices, manufactured in 1986, 1990 and 2019
* 32 LTZ1000ACH#PBF production devices, manufactured in the end of 2019 and 2020
* Fluke 5720A multi-function calibrator with output 7.19 VDC configured on 11V DC Voltage range
* xDevs.com QVR device with four LTZ1000ACH averaged with passive resistor network

Noise floor of the measurement setup and shorted LNA input measured at **102 nV** with standard deviation **9 nV**. Setup utilize Tektronix DPO7104C real-time oscilloscope and battery-powered AC-coupled LNA with gain +80 dB and pass-band 0.1-10 Hz. All zener chips were evaluated with bipolar Fluke 792A battery power supply to avoid any electrical interference from power line or ground loops. 

Zener current on test FX module PCB was set to 4.05 mA for ADR1000 and about 5.0 mA for LTZ1000. This was achieved by populated 120 &Omega; high stability wirewound resistor from zener chip anode diode pin 4 and reference return point pin 7.

Chips were installed in a socket populated on [xDevs.com FX reference module](https://xdevs.com/article/792x) replicating LTZ1000A recommended circuit from datasheet. Raw 6.62/7.x V output signal routed directly to LNA input via shielded coaxial cable. Each chip was powered up for 30 minutes to reach stable oven operating point and settled voltage across LNA input DC block capacitor. Whole module shielded in a metal can to reduce ambient noise interference during the measurement time.

![Noise chart summary](https://xdevs.com/doc/xDevs.com/QVRA/lf_noise_chart.png)

Vertical axis represents measured noise voltage and horizontal axis represent sample number. Blue round markers represent ADR1000 chips, triangles LTZ1000ACH and diamonds LTZ1000CH. Dashed line outline test setup noise floor limit.

Based on these values new Analog Devices ADR1000AHZ device measured to have 55.4% less noise than older Linear Technology LTZ1000ACH IC. This conclusion also supported by matching noise performance of single ADR1000AHZ compared to combined averaged noise from array of four selected LTZ1000A at a fraction of the BOM cost and power consumption. New reference IC can be very helpful for applications where low frequency noise is a critical performance parameter.
