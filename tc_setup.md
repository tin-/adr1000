Temperature is large factor and possible measurement error contributor of the laboratory instrument. Amplitude of temperature-related output change determines temperature coefficient and depends on many design features, such as materials, power distribution, physical layout and electrical circuit design. Minimizing temperature coefficient can be achieved by using material junctions with low parasitic EMF, careful thermal design with optimized uniformity and active heating/cooling stabilisation.

Buried zeners such as LTZ1000, ADR1000, LM399 and ADR1399 implement integrated on-chip heating to remove most of temperature coefficient. Residual coefficient mostly depends on circuit design and component choice. This can be measured by long-scale DVM with external environmental chamber with programmable temperature. ADR1000 modules temperature coefficient evaluated over the temperature range from +18 C to +28 C over the 24 hour test duration. Temperature coefficient test was performed with 8 steps. 

Instrument setup consisted of set of stable 3458A DMMs, programmable air-bath with TEC-based heatpump operated by Model 2510 SMU in bipolar mode. Air bath configured to provide both heating and cooling to allow temperatures above and below ambient. Temperature of the DUT module was measured separately by precision PT1000 RTD and Model 1529 temperature readout with uncertainty &plusmn;0.5 &deg;C. Modules under test were powered by battery pack, same one that used in noise measurement experiments.

Module under test was sweeped multiple times from +18.0 &deg;C to +28.0 &deg;C set temperature after initial warmup around 3-4 hours. Sweep Module was powered by Fluke 792A battery pack and output digitized by three [HP3458A DVMs](https://xdevs.com/fix/hp3458a) continously. 

Temperature sweep rate varied from 0.1 &deg;C to 0.04 &deg;C/minute to verify settling time of the assembly under test. Then second order polynominal was best fit to the measured voltage points and temperature coefficients were calculated as result, with new final &alpha; = -0.040 &micro;V/V/K ; &beta; = +0.0017 &micro;V/V/K² and zero TCR intersection crossover point calculated at *+34.5 &deg;C*. Summary table presented below.

Temperature chart in the programmable air-bath sensor, placed next to the DUT module is also available. Temperature sensor used is Honeywell HEL-705 PT1000 RTD, digitized with Fluke 1529 thermometer readout. Small +0.2 &deg;C offset was observed during the measurement due to local heating from the power dissipated in the module inside the airbath.

Environmental parameters such as ambient temperature, pressure and humidity were monitored by [Bosch BME280-based sensor](https://xdevs.com/guide/thp_rpi/), digitized directly with Raspberry Pi 3B I2C interface bus. This sensor provided reference data to ensure that ambient conditions were stable and within short-term 24-hour stability specificaitons of used DVMs. Overall ambient temperature change during the whole test duration was recorded at 0.36 &deg;C. No additional correction to DMM temperature coefficient applied.
