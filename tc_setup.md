Temperature is a large factor and possible measurement error contributor of the laboratory instrument. Amplitude of temperature-related output change determines temperature coefficient and depends on many design features, such as materials, power distribution, physical layout and electrical circuit design. Minimizing temperature coefficient can be achieved by using material junctions with low parasitic EMF, careful thermal design with optimized uniformity and active heating/cooling stabilization.

Buried zeners such as LTZ1000, ADR1000, LM399 and ADR1399 implement integrated on-chip heating to remove most of the temperature coefficient. Residual coefficient mostly depends on circuit design and component choice. This can be measured by long-scale DVM with external environmental chamber with programmable temperature. ADR1000 module's temperature coefficient evaluated over the temperature range from +18 C to +28 C over the 24-hour test duration. The temperature coefficient test was performed with 8 steps. 

The instrument setup consisted of a set of stable 3458A DMMs, programmable air-bath with TEC-based heat pump operated by Model 2510 SMU in bipolar mode. The air bath is configured to provide both heating and cooling to allow temperatures above and below ambient. The temperature of the DUT module was measured separately by precision PT1000 RTD and Model 1529 temperature readout with uncertainty &plusmn;0.5 &deg;C. Modules under test were powered by a battery pack, the same one that used in noise measurement experiments.

This cycling sequence, data collection and communication with instruments over GPIB was automated with [open-source Python program called TECkit](https://xdevs.com/guide/teckit) running on single-board computer Raspberry Pi 3B. Exact build used to perform these measurements is also [included in this repository](https://github.com/tin-/adr1000/tree/main/python). It is configured to run in console with python-vxi11 and Python 3.x environment.

Based on this instrumentation the following results were obtained:

## ADR1000AHZ module QVR4, four chips individual outputs, without trim

The first test is to measure voltage stability against temperature change of individual zener output for each of the two populated circuits on the QVR module PCBA. This is achieved by removing the connection to the averaging resistor network at the output of each cell and routing kelvin-connected 6.6 V to separate DMM. This way, it is possible to evaluate ADR1000 circuit performance without the effects of the output gain 10 V amplifier added. ADR1000s circuit temperature coefficient can be compensated and adjusted to very low numbers by multiple methods, such as changing series resistance to zener cathode terminal or adding a weak feedback from voltage loop to oven control loop (with series resistor in order 100 k&Omega; to 1 M&Omega; between heater transistor emitter and ADR1000 zener anode pin 4).

![https://xdevs.com/doc/xDevs.com/QVRA/qvrq_ref_1.jpg](https://xdevs.com/doc/xDevs.com/QVRA/qvrq_ref.jpg)

This PCBA was populated with four cells, each with own ADR1000 chip, opamps, resistors, heater transistor and all additional components. Each cell utilized OPA2140 opamp with temperature setpoint resistor divider VPG VHD200 11.5 k&Omega; | 1 k&Omega; and VPG VHP202 80 &Omega; for zener current setting.

The module under test with quad ADR1000 zener ICs swept multiple times from a wider +17.0 &deg;C to +55.0 &deg;C set temperature after initial warmup around 3 hours. Excessive maximum temperature was set deliberately to determine actual ADR1000 integrated oven thermal margin.

The test module was powered by linear triple channel power supply and output digitized by three [HP3458A DVMs](https://xdevs.com/fix/hp3458a) and one Keithley 2002LTC continuously. 

* Cell A ran out of the temperature margin at T = +48.6 &deg;C
* Cell B ran out of the temperature margin at T = +48.5 &deg;C
* Cell C ran out of the temperature margin at T = +46.0 &deg;C
* Cell D ran out of the temperature margin at T = +46.6 &deg;C

This data gives about 2...5 degree margin room between ambient temperature to calculated oven set point +51.0 °C which is pretty close to expected deviation. Some of the heat from the onboard oven is lost in thermal dissipation into PCB, cover and air around the chip, since ADR1000 does not use thermal insulation glass balls like the LTZ1000ACH. To be safe in a practical circuit, it would be reasonable to maintain at least 10 ° margin between maximum acceptable ambient/module temperature and actual ADR1000 oven temperature set point. For the completeness, here's calculated temperature coefficients with zener outside the temperature range with ambient temperature above oven set point.

In the temperature range +23 &deg;C to +40 &deg;C, which is within the safe margin with the oven operating in proper regulation, temperature coefficient was measured and calculated from a single sweep from +23 +40 °C to +40 °C. This was done without any additional temperature trim resistor to compensate for the inherent negative temperature coefficient of the ADR1000 zener and voltage loop transistor.

Cell D temperature coefficient is not too bad, but all the other cells require additional trimming to reduce temperature coefficient.

This run produced better temperature stability for cells A,B,C and similar performance of Cell D. Now if we combine all the cell outputs together with amplifier to get 10 V nominal output temperature coefficient of boost stage will also interact with the circuit performance.

Now this result is pretty good and on par with the typical adjusted and well behaved LTZ1000-based zener reference.

## ADR1000AHZ module QVR4, four chips averaged, trimmed and amplified for 10 V output

Temperature coefficient is sorted out to acceptable level, but output 10 V gain stage still require adjustment of it's large +2705 &micro;V/V offset. It's not particularly important for long-term study but it's more convinient to have 10 V output closer to the nominal value. This offset adjustment is accomplished by populating additional 80 &Omega; BMF resistor in the output divider feedback circuit for final amplifier. To ensure that output temperature stability did not suffer significantly one more sweep was done with two different digitizers.

Now output offset is only +19.4 and +18.3 &micro;V/V according to DMM1 and DMM2 with temperature coefficient almost unchanged. This was considered acceptable result and quad ADR1000 reference at this point was returned back into the zener array bank to continue long-term drift measurements.

## LTD-QVR module with mixed zeners, four chips individual outputs, with trim

Additional module was assembled fresh on February 11, 2024 with goal to run different chips in the same PCBA in same conditions and compare their long-term stability from first power on. 

![LTD QVR module](https://xdevs.com/doc/xDevs.com/QVRL/img/block_ltdb.png)

No special aging was performed on any of the chips. They sat on the shelf with normal environment conditions unused for some time and now just soldered on the board fresh.

## ADR1000AHZ module QVR2, two chips, individual 6.62 V zener IC outputs

First test is to measure voltage stability against temperature change of individual zener output for each of the two populated circuits on the QVR module PCBA. This is achieved by removing the connection to averaging resistor network at the output of each cell and routing kelvin-connected 6.6 V to separate DMM. This way it is possible to evaluate ADR1000 circuit performance without the effects of the output gain 10 V amplifier added. ADR1000 circuit tempco can be compensated and adjusted to very low numbers by multiple methods, such as changing series resistance to zener cathode terminal or adding a weak feedback from voltage loop to oven control loop (with series resistor in order 100 k&Omega; to 1 M&Omega; between heater transistor emitter and ADR1000 zener anode pin 4). 

[CSV RAW-datafile](https://xdevs.com/doc/xDevs.com/QVRA/qvr_dual_raw_temperature_sweep_jan2024.csv)

The module under test with dual ADR1000 zener IC swept multiple times from +18.0 &deg;C to +28.0 &deg;C set temperature after initial warmup around 3-4 hours. The test module was powered by Fluke 792A battery pack and output digitized by three [HP3458A DVMs](https://xdevs.com/fix/hp3458a) continuously. 

The temperature sweep rate varied from 0.005 &deg;C/minute to verify settling time of the assembly under test. Then the second order polynominal was best fit to the measured voltage points and temperature coefficients were calculated. First cell measured &alpha; = -0.0168 &micro;V/V/K ; &beta; = +0.0008 &micro;V/V/K² and zero TCR intersection crossover point calculated at *+33.0 &deg;C*. Second cell measured slightly worse &alpha; = -0.0325 &micro;V/V/K ; &beta; = +0.018 &micro;V/V/K² and zero TCR intersection crossover point calculated at *+33.0 &deg;C*. Both cells demonstrated excellent temperature stability performance after trimming.

Environmental parameters such as ambient temperature, pressure and humidity were monitored by [Bosch BME280-based sensor](https://xdevs.com/guide/thp_rpi/), digitized directly with Raspberry Pi 3B I2C interface bus. This sensor provided reference data to ensure that ambient conditions were stable and within short-term 24-hour stability specifications of used DVMs. Overall ambient temperature change during the whole test duration was recorded at 0.36 &deg;C. No additional correction to DMM temperature coefficient applied.
